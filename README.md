# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

npm install to install all necessary files

npm start to start the react app

I've set up the frontend to run on port 3001 so it won't interfere with the rails backend.

You can find the backend for this project here: https://github.com/iaouvaeiru/adnat-backend
